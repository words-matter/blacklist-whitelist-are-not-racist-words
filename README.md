# Blacklist and whitelist are not racist words

Some argue that blacklist/whitelist are racist words.
That's wrong.
Unless you're a racist, you wouldn't see black and white people in these terms.

## TD;DR

- The etymology of "blacklist" has nothing to do with racism.
- Blacklist has never been used as a discriminatory word against black people.
- Black often carries negative connotations across many languages and cultures, including non-Western ones, because we humans are diurnal creatures.

## Background

The entire movement initaially targetted removal of the master/slave terminology due to alleged racial stereotyping.
In 2014, [Django](https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692), [CouchDB](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-2248), and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/node/2275877) removed these.
[Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/3185) and [Python](https://bugs.python.org/issue34605) also followed this movement in 2016 and in 2018 respecively.

In August, 2018, being influenced by [a tweet](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/1030200563802230786) that recieved 2.4K RTs and 5K likes, [DHH removed use of blacklist and whitelist from Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/33677).
Though there had been several [attempts](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=842296), tech folks had not taken it seriously to remove blacklist/whitelist until the recent death of a black man.

On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a black American man, was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Following this event, protests led by Black Lives Matter happened all over the United States.
People in other nations also joined this movement, resulting in making it an unprecedentedly huge global movement.
At first, the main concern of this movement was police brutality; however, it soon turned into a civil right movement that addresses alleged systemic racism against black people.
Many industries showed solidarity with black people by making changes in their own ways.

Folks in the tech industry were not an exception.
They sought for ways to fight against racism.
As a result, the discussion on blacklist/whitelist recurred.
The following [tweet](https://twitter.com/leahculver/status/1269109776983547904) from a white woman gained over 4K RTs and 17K likes:

> I refuse to use “whitelist”/“blacklist” or “master”/“slave” terminology for computers. Join me. Words matter.

Since then, removing blacklist/whitelist from codebase has become a controversial trend in the tech industry.
Famous projects such as [Go](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/608cdcaede1e7133dc994b5e8894272c2dce744b), [Chromium](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2234793), [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/5546), and [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/commit/8e9c76d33dab4095c9066072076f368193e4166d) have supported this movement and have removed blacklist/whitelist from their codebase.
Other projects such as [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/12089), on the other hand, declined to merge term changes.

As far as I have observed, most of those who advocate removal of blacklist are white people.
Some black people were grateful for this movement, but it is worth mentioning that there are also quite a few black people who hate this movement.

## Etymology and Usage

Even though "blacklist" has nothing to do with racism, there are people who want to believe that it is a racially charged offensive word.
They claim that blacklist has racist origins, which is not true, and that the association of the color black with negative meanings should be discouraged, which is impossible.

First of all, blacklist's etymology has nothing to do with discrimination against black people. 
Around the beginning of the 17th century, the adjective black was already used to indicate disgrace in a certain way, according to [Macmillian Dictionary](https://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/blacklist):

> From 1590 to around 1610, the adjective black could be used to indicate ‘disgrace, punishment and general censure’ when used in a certain way, for example in the term black book.

The word blacklist appeared after that to refer to a list of troublesome people. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting#Origins_of_the_term), there is a record that an English dramatist used "blacklist" in 1639. Blacklist did not mean that it is a list of the Negroid, even from its birth.

Nevertheless, there are people who are very desparate to believe that blacklist's etymology is racist. They like to cite an academic paper entitled [“Blacklists” and “whitelists”: a salutary warning concerning the prevalence of racist language in discussions of predatory publishing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6148600/), published in Journal of the **Medical** Library Association, written by two **psycologists**.
This paper was not published by professional etymologists, and has never recieved any academic credit by etymologists.
In fact, its citation count is only [four](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?rlz=1C5CHFA_enJP805JP807&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=17419557131221922597), which is really small.
A small citation count does not necessarily dispute the validity of the paper, but it often suggests that its claims are not widely accepted in the academic community.

Also, the paper's claims are solely based on subjective speculations, which makes the argument of the paper even weaker.
The only reason why the authors thought blacklist was a racist word is because the word appeared around the same period as the wake of black slavery:

> It is notable that the first recorded use of the term occurs at the time of mass enslavement and forced deportation of Africans to work in European-held colonies in the Americas.

Even though this paper looks like a legit academic paper, it is not.
Anyone with proper education would automatically throw away this paper in the trash can.

The usage of blacklist has never been racially discriminatory as well.
English dictionaries do not define blacklist as a racist word.
[The Oxford English dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/blacklist) defines "blacklist" as follows:

> A list of people or things that are regarded as unacceptable or untrustworthy and should be excluded or avoided.

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blacklist) defines it as:

> 1: a list of persons who are disapproved of or are to be punished or boycotted
2: a list of banned or excluded things of disreputable character

It is evident that there is no mention of black people nor discriminatory usage.
Also, the fact that there have been huge push backs from people around the globe suggests that blacklist has not been widely recognized as a discriminatory word.

Both etymology-wise and usage-wise, blacklist has nothing to do with racism.
Now, I have no choice but to conclude that those who advocate removal of blacklist due to racial stereotyping are just being emotional.

## Black Color and Negative Connotations

The ultimate goal of blacklist-banners is often to dissociate negative connotations from the color black.
This is simply ridiculous and meaningless because the association of black with negativeness is quite natural and not exclusive to the Western culture.
We humans are diurnal creatures, thus we fear darkness for lack of sights and potential dangers of predetors.
Because of this, the color black is often associated with something evil, fearful, scary, or negative in many cultures and languages.
Therefore, it is an endless effort to remove such primitive meanings from colors.
It makes more sense to stop calling black people "black" because that is the root cause of every problem.

## Suggestions

- Instead of trying to remove the association of the color black with negative meanings, stop calling a group of people with a color.
- Try not to waste other people's time for nonsense. Use your time to address bigger issues, such as hiring problems in the tech industry.
- Try not to call those who resist changing terms "racists" just because you delusionally find some words racially offensive.

## Conclusion

In the wake of the death of George Floyd, the tech industry, which is dominated by white American leftists, is trying to end racism by removing certain allegedly racially sensitive terms such as blacklist and whitelist, even though these terms have nothing to do with racism in terms of their usage and etymology at all.
They are trying to weaken the association between the color black and negative connotations, which is totally pointless and would require infinite amount of time to complete.
It would make more sense if we use our time for more meaningful things that have real impacts on racial inequality.
